## Deployment Commands

### Step 1: Build the App
```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles both client and server code to the `dist` folder.

### Step 2: Upload to Reddit
```bash
npm run deploy
```

Or manually:
```bash
npx devvit upload
```

**What this does:**
- Uploads your app to Reddit's servers
- Creates a new version
- Makes it available for installation (private)

**Output:**
```
âœ“ App uploaded successfully
Version: 0.2.4
App ID: ocrdocs
```

### Step 3: Test in Production Environment
1. Install on your test subreddit
2. Create a post using the moderator menu
3. Test all functionality
4. Verify splash screen appears correctly
5. Test on both desktop and mobile

### Step 4: Publish for Review (Optional)
If you want to make your app public:

```bash
npm run launch
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
npx devvit publish
```

**What this does:**
- Submits app for Reddit review
- Required for subreddits with >200 members
- Review typically takes 1-3 days

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning
Use this format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

**Examples:**
- `1.0.0` - First production release
- `1.0.1` - Bug fix
- `1.1.0` - New feature (backwards compatible)
- `2.0.0` - Breaking changes

### Update Version
Edit `package.json`:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Installation Process

### For Your Subreddit
1. Go to your subreddit
2. Mod Tools â†’ Apps
3. Find "Document Manager" (ocrdocs)
4. Click "Install"
5. Grant required permissions

### For Other Subreddits
After publishing:
1. Share app link: `https://developers.reddit.com/apps/ocrdocs`
2. Moderators can install from Reddit's app directory
3. Or search "Document Manager" in app marketplace

## Post-Deployment

### Monitor Usage
- Check Reddit Developer Portal for analytics
- Monitor error logs: `npx devvit logs r/your_subreddit`
- Watch for user feedback

### View Logs
```bash
# Real-time logs
npx devvit logs r/ocrdocs_dev

# Last 15 minutes
npx devvit logs r/ocrdocs_dev --since 15m

# Specific app
npx devvit logs r/ocrdocs_dev --app ocrdocs
```

### Update Existing Installation
When you deploy a new version:
1. Run `npm run deploy`
2. Existing installations auto-update
3. No need to reinstall

## Rollback

If something goes wrong:
```bash
# List versions
npx devvit versions

# Rollback to previous version
npx devvit rollback <version>
```

## Production Checklist

### Before First Deploy
- [ ] Convert splash assets to PNG
- [ ] Test on desktop browser
- [ ] Test on mobile browser
- [ ] Update version to 1.0.0
- [ ] Remove any test/debug code
- [ ] Verify .env is in .gitignore

### Deploy Commands
```bash
# 1. Build
npm run build

# 2. Deploy
npm run deploy

# 3. Test on your subreddit
# Visit: https://reddit.com/r/ocrdocs_dev

# 4. If ready for public, publish
npm run launch
```

### After Deploy
- [ ] Test installation on subreddit
- [ ] Create test post
- [ ] Upload test document
- [ ] Verify splash screen
- [ ] Test on mobile
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors

## Common Issues

### Issue: "App name already exists"
**Solution:** You cannot change the app name. It's permanently "ocrdocs"

### Issue: "Version already exists"
**Solution:** Increment version in package.json

### Issue: "Build failed"
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf dist node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Issue: "Upload failed"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-authenticate
npx devvit login
npm run deploy
```

### Issue: "Splash screen not showing"
**Solution:** 
- Verify PNG files exist in `assets/` folder
- Check file sizes (must be under 1MB)
- Create a new post (old posts keep old splash)
