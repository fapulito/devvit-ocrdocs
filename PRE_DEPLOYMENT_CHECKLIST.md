# Pre-Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Code Changes Complete

- [x] Removed custom admin endpoint from `src/server/index.ts`
- [x] Updated `src/server/ai/gemini.ts` to use Devvit settings
- [x] Added settings configuration to `devvit.json`
- [x] Updated all documentation
- [x] Build successful with no errors
- [x] No TypeScript diagnostics

## 📋 Before Deploying

### 1. Set the Gemini API Key
```bash
npx devvit settings set apiKey "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

### 2. Verify Settings
```bash
npx devvit settings list
```

You should see:
```
apiKey: ********** (set)
```

### 3. Build and Upload
```bash
# Build and upload
npm run deploy

# Or do it manually:
npm run build
npx devvit upload
```

## 🧪 After Deployment - Testing

### Test the Analysis Endpoint

1. Upload a document through the UI
2. Check if AI analysis runs automatically
3. Verify description and summary are generated

### Check Logs

```bash
# View logs for your app
npx devvit logs YOUR_SUBREDDIT --since 5m
```

Look for:
- `[Gemini] Client initialized successfully`
- `[Analysis] Starting document analysis`
- No "API key not configured" errors

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If analysis fails with "API key not configured"

1. Verify the setting is set:
   ```bash
   npx devvit settings list
   ```

2. If not set, run:
   ```bash
   npx devvit settings set apiKey "YOUR_KEY"
   ```

3. Re-upload if needed:
   ```bash
   npx devvit upload
   ```

### If you see "settings is not defined" error

This means the Devvit SDK version might not support settings. Check:
```bash
npm list @devvit/web
```

Should be a recent version that supports settings.

## 📝 What Changed

This deployment migrates from Redis-based API key storage to Devvit's built-in settings system:

- **Before**: Custom admin endpoint + Redis storage
- **After**: CLI-based settings management

See `GEMINI_SETTINGS_MIGRATION.md` for full details.

## ✅ Ready to Deploy

All checks passed! You can now:

1. Set the API key: `npx devvit settings set apiKey`
2. Upload: `npx devvit upload`
3. Test the analysis feature
