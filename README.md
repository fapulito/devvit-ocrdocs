### What It Does

Document Manager is a full-featured document organization app that runs inside Reddit posts. Upload images and PDFs of receipts, invoices, notes, forms, contracts, or any important documents, add descriptions and notes, and access them anytime from the same Reddit post. Each document is stored with metadata and a preview (for images), making it easy to find what you need at a glance.

The app launches directly into a clean three-tab interface with a modern dark gradient theme:
- **Setup**: Configure your Google Gemini API key for AI-powered document analysis (one-time setup per post)
- **Upload Document**: Upload images or PDFs (both with 500KB limit), with optional AI analysis, add descriptions, and optional notes
- **My Documents**: Browse all your uploaded documents in a visual grid with previews, descriptions, and timestamps

The app features **AI-powered document analysis** using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash API to automatically extract key information from your documents:
- **Easy Setup**: Configure your Gemini API key once through the Setup tab - stored securely in Redis
- **Smart Description Generation**: AI analyzes your document and suggests a concise description (max 80 characters)
- **Automatic Summarization**: Extracts key details like amounts, dates, and important information (max 400 characters)
- **Intelligent Text Recognition**: Works with both images and PDFs to understand document content
- **Auto-Analyze Toggle**: Enable or disable automatic AI analysis when uploading documents
- **Re-Analyze Button**: Regenerate AI analysis if you're not satisfied with the initial results
- **Manual Override**: Edit AI-generated descriptions and summaries before saving
- **Safe Submission**: Prevents accidental form submission while AI analysis is in progress
- **Intelligent Caching**: Analysis results cached for 7 days with MD5 hash-based cache keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Fair usage with 100 analysis requests per user per day

### What Makes It Innovative

- **AI-Powered Document Analysis**: Integration with Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API automatically analyzes documents and extracts key information
  - **Smart Description Generation**: AI reads your document and suggests a concise, accurate description (max 80 characters)
  - **Automatic Summarization**: Extracts amounts, dates, reference numbers, and key details from receipts, invoices, and forms (max 400 characters)

  - **Auto-Analyze Toggle**: Enable or disable automatic AI analysis when uploading documents
  - **Safe Form Submission**: Prevents accidental submission while AI analysis is in progress
  - **Intelligent Caching**: Analysis results cached for 7 days to improve performance and reduce API costs
  - **Rate Limiting**: Fair usage with 100 analysis requests per user per day

### Tips for Best Organization

- **One-Time Setup**: Configure your Gemini API key once in the Setup tab - it's stored securely in Redis and persists across sessions
- **Get a Free API Key**: Visit https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey to get a free Gemini API key (15 requests/minute, 1,500 requests/day free tier)
- **AI Analysis**: Enable auto-analyze for automatic description generation, or disable it if you prefer manual entry
- **Re-Analyze Feature**: If the AI's first analysis isn't perfect, click "Re-analyze" to try again
- **Edit AI Content**: Always review and edit AI-generated descriptions and notes before saving
- **Caching Benefits**: Duplicate uploads use cached analysis results (free, instant)
- **Desktop Recommended**: File uploads work best on desktop browsers due to Reddit app limitations on mobile

- **Descriptive Titles**: Use clear, searchable descriptions (e.g., "2024 Tax Return" or "Q4 Sales Report" instead of "Document 1")
- **Add Notes**: Include key details in notes for easier searching later (dates, amounts, reference numbers, key points)
- **Regular Cleanup**: Delete outdated documents to keep your collection manageable (20 document limit per post)
- **Regular Backups**: Use the "Copy All" button to backup your document metadata regularly
- **Save Documents**: 
  - Images: Right-click to save locally, or open in new tab for easier downloading
  - PDFs: Currently stored as base64 - save original files separately for full PDF access
- **Image Quality**: Use clear, well-lit photos for better readability when viewing later
- **PDF Organization**: Use PDFs for single-page documents, receipts, or forms under 500KB
- **Consistent Naming**: Develop a naming convention for similar document types
- **Error Handling**: If upload or deletion fails, you'll see clear error messages in a red alert box with details
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Delete operations require confirmation to prevent accidental removal
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons show loading states ("Uploading...", "Deleting...") so you know the app is processing your request
