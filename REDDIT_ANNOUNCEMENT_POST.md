# 🚀 Introducing OCR Docs on Reddit - AI-Powered Document Intelligence! 📄✨

Hey r/ocrdocs_dev! 👋

I'm excited to share the **Devvit port** of my AWS AI Agent Hackathon project - an intelligent document processing platform that brings enterprise-grade OCR directly to Reddit! 🎉

## 🤖 What Makes This Special?

This isn't just basic OCR - it's an **autonomous AI agent** that:

- 📸 **Extracts text** from images and documents with Amazon Textract precision
- 🧠 **Understands context** using Claude 3 Haiku AI
- 💰 **Analyzes bills** automatically (power bills, invoices, receipts)
- 📊 **Structures data** into clean, downloadable formats
- 💾 **Stores documents** right in your Reddit posts

## 💡 The Technology

Built with cutting-edge tech:
