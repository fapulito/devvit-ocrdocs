# Reddit for Developers

## Docs

- [Forms](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/client/forms.md): A form lets your app ask users to input and submit data. Forms can be defined with a simple form object that takes a list of fields, and return user responses directly as promises.
- [Menu Actions](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/client/menu-actions.md): Add an item to the three dot menu for posts, comments, or subreddits. Menu actions can perform immediate client effects or trigger server processing followed by client effects.
- [Navigation](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/client/navigation.md): Use navigation functions to redirect users to Reddit content or external websites in response to user actions, such as button clicks. You can redirect to a url string or to objects such as Subreddit, Post, or Comment.
- [Overview](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/client/overview.md): Client-side effects enable your Devvit app to provide interactive feedback and navigation to users. These effects include showing toasts, displaying forms, navigating to different pages, and more.
- [Toasts](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/client/toasts.md): Display temporary notification messages to users at the bottom of the screen.
- [Configure Your App](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/devvit-web/devvit_web_configuration.md): The devvit.json file serves as your app's configuration file. Use it to specify entry points, configure features like event triggers and scheduled actions, and enable app functionality such as image uploads. This page covers all available devvit.json configuration options. A complete devvit.json example file is provided here.
- [Devvit Web](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/devvit-web/devvit_web_overview.md): Devvit Web includes an easy way to build Devvit apps using a standard web stack.
- [Overview](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/interactive-posts/interactive_posts_overview.md): Interactive posts are the core of Reddit Dev Platform apps, enabling rich, engaging experiences that go beyond static content. There are three essential features for creating an interactive post using the Reddit API :
- [Overview](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/realtime/overview.md): Create live and event-driven interactive posts. Realtime provides a set of primitives that lets you build interactive posts that are:
- [Realtime in Devvit Blocks](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/realtime/realtime_in_devvit_blocks.md): This guide walks through step-by-step instructions on how to set up Realtime in a Devvit Blocks application
- [HTTP Fetch](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/http-fetch.md): Make requests to allow-listed external domains.
- [HTTP Fetch Policy](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/http-fetch-policy.md): When requesting domains to be allow-listed, they fall into three categories:
- [Media Uploads](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/media-uploads.md): Apps can only display images hosted on Reddit
- [Overview](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/overview.md): Devvit offers a wide variety of features that help you integrate your app with Reddit's APIs, scale your app free of charge using Reddit's backend, and more. The features in this section are executed on the server side. They can be imported in both Devvit Web and Devvit Blocks applications, as well as Mod Tools.
- [Post Data](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/post-data.md): You can attach small amounts of data (2KB) to a post when creating it and update this data using the postData capability. This enables dynamic, stateful experiences available on posts without a server call. Post data is scoped to the post, not users.
- [Overview](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/reddit-api.md): The Reddit API allows you to read and write Reddit content such as posts / comments / upvotes, in order to integrate your app's behavior with the content of the community it's installed in.
- [Redis](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/redis.md): You can add a database to your app to store and retrieve data. The Redis plugin is designed to be fast, scalable, and secure. It supports a subset of the full Redis API, including:
- [Scheduler](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/scheduler.md): The scheduler allows your app to perform actions at specific times, such as sending private messages, tracking upvotes, or scheduling timeouts for user actions. You can schedule both recurring and one-off jobs using the scheduler.
- [Settings and Secrets](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/settings-and-secrets.md): Configure your app with settings that can be customized per subreddit or globally across all installations. Settings allow moderators to customize app behavior for their subreddit, while secrets enable secure storage of sensitive data like API keys.
- [Splash Screens](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/splash-screen.md): Splash screens provide a personalized entry point for your Reddit Dev Platform apps, displaying a customized loading view before users interact with your post. A well-designed splash screen improves first impressions and drives better user engagement.
- [Text Fallback for old.reddit](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/text_fallback.md): Old.reddit does not render interactive posts. To remedy this, use textFallback to ensure that you can specify the text for the instances when Devvit cannot render your post. You can do this with a text string or in rich text.
- [Triggers](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/triggers.md): Triggers allow your app to automatically respond to specific events or actions within a Reddit community. Use triggers to build automation, moderation, and engagement features that react to user or moderator activity.
- [User actions](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/server/userActions.md): User actions allow your app to perform certain actions—such as creating posts, comments, or subscribing to subreddits—on behalf of the user, rather than the app account. This enables stronger user engagement while ensuring user control and transparency.
- [Add Payments](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/earn-money/payments/payments_add.md): Payments is a beta feature. As of this moment Payments is still not supported in Devvit Web applications. Only applications built with Devvit Blocks can support Payments
- [Manage Payments](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/earn-money/payments/payments_manage.md): Once your app and products have been approved, you’re ready to use Reddit’s production payments system. Real payments will be triggered automatically when invoked from approved app versions. No code changes are required.
- [Overview](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/earn-money/payments/payments_overview.md): Payments is a beta feature. As of this moment Payments will be supported in Devvit Web applications in September. Only applications built with Devvit Blocks can support Payments
- [Publish Your App](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/earn-money/payments/payments_publish.md): The Developer Platform team reviews and approves apps and their products before products can be sold.
- [Test Payments](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/earn-money/payments/payments_test.md): Use the payments sandbox environment to simulate payment transactions. All apps automatically start in the payments sandbox.
- [Support This App](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/earn-money/payments/support_this_app.md): You can ask users to contribute to your app’s development by adding the “support this app” feature. This allows users to support your app with Reddit gold in exchange for some kind of award or recognition.
- [Reddit Developer Funds 2025](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/earn-money/reddit_developer_funds.md): Reddit developer funds is a way for developers to earn money for the apps they build. Devs can earn up to $500,000 for their apps, or $167,000 per app.
