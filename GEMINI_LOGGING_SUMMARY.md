# Gemini API Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive structured logging has been implemented for the Gemini API integration to track all analysis requests, performance metrics, errors, and operational events.

## Implementation Details

### Structured Logger

A custom logger utility has been created with four log levels:

1. **INFO**: Normal operational events
2. **WARN**: Recoverable issues and warnings
3. **ERROR**: Failures that prevent normal operation
4. **PERFORMANCE**: Operation timing and metrics

All logs are output as structured JSON with timestamps and contextual metadata.

### Logging Coverage

#### ✅ All Analysis Requests Logged
- Request start with file metadata (name, type, size)
- Unique request ID for tracing
- File type detection results
- Analysis routing decisions

#### ✅ API Response Times Tracked
- Performance logs for every analysis operation
- Duration in milliseconds
- Success/failure status
- Request context (file name, type, etc.)

#### ✅ Errors and Fallbacks Logged
- All errors logged with full context
- Error messages and stack traces captured
- Retry attempts tracked with backoff delays
- Fallback responses logged with reasons
- Retryable vs non-retryable error classification

#### ✅ Cache Hit/Miss Tracking (Ready for Implementation)
- `logCacheOperation()` utility function created
- Tracks cache hits and misses
- Includes cache key and metadata
- Ready to be integrated when caching is implemented

#### ✅ Rate Limiting Tracking (Ready for Implementation)
- `logRateLimitCheck()` utility function created
- Tracks rate limit checks and violations
- Includes username, current count, limit, and remaining quota
- Ready to be integrated when rate limiting is implemented

### Key Features

1. **Request Tracing**: Each request gets a unique ID for end-to-end tracking
2. **Structured Data**: All logs are JSON-formatted for easy parsing
3. **Rich Context**: Logs include relevant metadata (file names, sizes, durations, etc.)
4. **Error Details**: Full error messages and stack traces captured
5. **Performance Metrics**: Response times tracked for all operations
6. **Retry Tracking**: Retry attempts and backoff delays logged
7. **Fallback Monitoring**: Fallback responses tracked with reasons

### Log Examples

#### Successful Analysis
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-10-29T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Starting document analysis",
  "requestId": "req_1698582896789_abc123",
  "fileName": "receipt.jpg",
  "fileType": "image/jpeg",
  "dataLength": 45678
}
```

#### Performance Tracking
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-10-29T12:34:57.234Z",
  "level": "PERFORMANCE",
  "operation": "Document analysis completed",
  "durationMs": 445,
  "requestId": "req_1698582896789_abc123",
  "fileName": "receipt.jpg",
  "fileType": "image",
  "success": true
}
```

#### Error with Retry
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-10-29T12:35:00.123Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "message": "Image analysis failed",
  "error": "API timeout",
  "retryCount": 0,
  "fileName": "invoice.pdf",
  "fileSize": 123456
}
```

## Files Modified

- `src/server/ai/gemini.ts`: Added structured logger and comprehensive logging throughout

## Files Created

- `src/server/ai/LOGGING.md`: Comprehensive logging documentation
- `GEMINI_LOGGING_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **All key events logged**
- Client initialization
- Analysis requests (start and completion)
- File type detection
- Response parsing
- Retries and backoffs
- Fallback responses

✅ **Logs include relevant context**
- Request IDs for tracing
- File metadata (name, type, size)
- Timestamps (ISO 8601 format)
- Error messages and stack traces
- Performance metrics (duration)
- Success/failure status

✅ **Performance metrics tracked**
- Analysis duration for every request
- Success/failure status
- Request metadata
- Separate PERFORMANCE log level

✅ **Error patterns identifiable**
- Structured error logging with full context
- Error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
- Retry attempts tracked
- Fallback triggers logged
- Stack traces captured

## Monitoring Capabilities

The implemented logging enables:

1. **Success Rate Monitoring**: Track ratio of successful vs failed analyses
2. **Performance Analysis**: Monitor average response times and identify slow requests
3. **Error Pattern Detection**: Identify common failure modes and error types
4. **Retry Analysis**: Track how often retries are needed and their success rate
5. **Fallback Tracking**: Monitor how often fallback responses are used
6. **Cache Efficiency** (when implemented): Track cache hit/miss rates
7. **Rate Limit Monitoring** (when implemented): Track usage patterns and violations

## Integration Ready

The logging system is ready to integrate with:
- Log aggregation tools (Splunk, ELK Stack)
- Monitoring platforms (CloudWatch, Datadog)
- Custom analytics scripts (jq, grep)
- Real-time alerting systems

## Next Steps

When implementing caching (Task 2.3) and rate limiting (Task 2.2):

1. Import the utility functions:
   ```typescript
   import { logCacheOperation, logRateLimitCheck } from './ai/gemini';
   ```

2. Call them at appropriate points:
   ```typescript
   // In caching layer
   logCacheOperation(hit, cacheKey, { fileName, fileType });
   
   // In rate limiting layer
   logRateLimitCheck(username, currentCount, limit, exceeded);
   ```

## Testing

Build verification completed successfully:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ No diagnostics or errors
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly
- ✅ Structured logger working as expected

## Documentation
