# Document Manager for Reddit - Working App

## âœ… What's Working

A fully functional document management app built on Devvit that runs on Reddit!

### Features

1. **Upload Documents**
   - Upload images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP) and PDFs
   - Max file size: 2MB
   - Preview before saving

2. **Add Descriptions & Notes**
   - Required description for each document
   - Optional notes field for additional text/content
   - Perfect for manually adding text from documents

3. **View All Documents**
   - Grid view of all uploaded documents
   - Click to view full details
   - Shows thumbnails, descriptions, and timestamps

4. **Document Details**
   - Full-size image view
   - All metadata (filename, description, notes, upload date)
   - Delete functionality

5. **Redis Storage**
   - All documents stored per-post in Redis
   - Keeps last 100 documents per post
   - Fast retrieval and persistence

## How to Use

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the playtest URL** in your browser (shown in terminal)

3. **Upload a document:**
   - Click "Upload Document" tab
   - Select an image file
   - Add a description (required)
   - Add notes (optional) - this is where you can manually type text from the document
   - Click "Save Document"

4. **View your documents:**
   - Click "My Documents" tab
   - See all uploaded documents in a grid
   - Click any document to view full details

## Technical Details

- **Client**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Server**: Express with Devvit APIs
- **Storage**: Redis (per-post storage)
- **Authentication**: Automatic via Reddit/Devvit

## Why This Works (vs OCR)

The original OCR approach failed because:
- External API calls (OCR.space) are blocked by Devvit
- Client-side OCR libraries (tesseract-wasm) violate CSP with `unsafe-eval`
- Devvit has strict security policies for external domains

This Document Manager works because:
- No external API calls needed
- All processing happens client-side (file reading) or server-side (Redis storage)
- Users can manually add text content in the notes field
- Fully compliant with Devvit's security model

## Next Steps: Options B & C

### Option B: OCR via Proxy Server

To add real OCR functionality, you would need to:

1. **Deploy your own backend API** (e.g., on Vercel, Railway, or AWS Lambda)
   - This API would accept image uploads
   - Call OCR.space or Tesseract on the server
   - Return extracted text

2. **Request Devvit to whitelist your domain**
   - Contact Reddit developers
   - Provide your API domain
   - Wait for approval

3. **Update the app** to call your proxy instead of OCR.space directly

**Pros**: Real OCR functionality
**Cons**: Requires infrastructure, costs, and Devvit approval

### Option C: Other Devvit-Compatible Features

Instead of OCR, you could add:

1. **Image Filters/Effects**
   - Client-side canvas manipulation
   - Brightness, contrast, rotation
   - No external APIs needed

2. **Document Categories/Tags**
   - Organize documents by type
   - Search and filter functionality
   - All stored in Redis

3. **Sharing & Collaboration**
   - Share documents with other Reddit users
   - Comments on documents
   - Use Devvit's Reddit API

4. **Export Functionality**
   - Download all documents as ZIP
   - Export notes as text file
   - Generate PDF reports

5. **Document Templates**
   - Pre-made templates for receipts, invoices, etc.
   - Fill-in forms
   - Save as documents

6. **Barcode/QR Code Scanner**
   - Use browser APIs for scanning
   - No external services needed
   - Store scanned codes with documents

All of these work within Devvit's constraints and don't require external APIs!

## Recommendation

For a production app, I'd suggest:
- Keep the Document Manager as-is (it works great!)
- Add categories/tags for organization
- Add search functionality
- Consider Option B (proxy server) only if OCR is absolutely critical
- Focus on features that enhance the document management experience

The current app is fully functional and ready to use on Reddit!
